NPC folder is strictly for npc sprites.  NPCs themselves are defined per map, with the sprite that they use to display themselves being defined in their ini file.  

Remember when designing a sprite, all cells of the animation must be equal dimensions with no overlapping of the graphics for it to look proper in game.
